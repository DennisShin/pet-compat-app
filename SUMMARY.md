# Pet Compatability App

The creation of this project involved utilizing the FastAPI framework in Python to build a web application centered around pet compatibility. I had to learn new technologies such as FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
Initially, the backend was designed to handle the management of pets, enabling users to add, update, and delete their pets while identifying compatibility between different pets based on assigned personality traits. 
This architecture allowed for the secure and efficient storage of pet information. 
The project utilized Jinja2 templates to render data within a basic HTML interface, and I have also started a very basic frontend that utilizes the API that I created.
Throughout the process, the API documentation was auto generated by FastAPI which shows all of the different functions that are possible to use within my API.
